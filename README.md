# SOFIA Cookbook Recipes

These documents provide simple "recipes" (i.e., descriptions and guided examples) for common data analysis objectives using SOFIA processed data. They are generally written for a graduate student audience and are intended to be used with the [SOFIA Data Handbooks](https://www.sofia.usra.edu/science/proposing-and-observing/data-products/data-resources).

The recipes are all `jupyter` notebooks designed for a researcher with a working knowledge of the [numpy/scipy/matplotlib stack](https://scipy.org/install.html) as well the [astropy](http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/) modules.

The first notebook in the series walks the user through using the [SOFIA Data Cycle System (DCS)](https://dcs.sofia.usra.edu/) and will guide the reader through downloading a public data set on 30 Doradus with a walkthrough of basic analysis techniques with `python`.

## 30 Doradus/HAWC+ Cookbook

SOFIA performed far-infrared imaging polarimetric observations of [30 Doradus](https://www.sofia.usra.edu/multimedia/science-results-archive/sofia-reveals-never-seen-magnetic-field-details) using the High-resolution Airborne Wideband Camera-plus (HAWC+) at 53, 89, 154, and 214 micron. We present the status and quality of the observations, an overview of the SOFIA data products, and examples of working with HAWC+ polarimetric data that will enhance the scientific analysis of this, and future, data sets. These observations illustrate the potential influence of magnetic fields and turbulence in a star-forming region within the Tarantula Nebula.
