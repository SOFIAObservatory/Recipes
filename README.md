**Aim**: These documents provide simple "recipes" (i.e., descriptions and guided examples) for common data analysis objectives using SOFIA processed data.

**Skill level**: These are generally written for a graduate student audience. Some of the recipes are `jupyter` notebooks designed for a researcher with a working knowledge of the [numpy/scipy/matplotlib stack](https://scipy.org/install.html) as well the [astropy](http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/) modules.
