    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this `jupyter` recipe, we explain how to download SOFIA data through the Infrared Science Archive [(IRSA)](https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/applications/sofia/). We will be downloading HAWC+ data of 30 Doradus using different keywords.\n",

    "In https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/applications/sofia/, fill in the following fields\n",
    "- Spatial constraints:\n",
    "  - Coordinates or object name: `30 Dor`\n",
    "  - Radius: `600 arcseconds`\n",
    "- Click on the arrow next to Observation Constraints to open the drop-down options. \n",
    "- Instrument Constraints\n",
    "  - Select `HAWC+`\n",
    "- Data Product Constraints:\n",
    "  - Processing Level: `Level 4` (both Level 3 and 4 are science-ready products)\n",
    "  - Click the `Search` button\n",
    "- After the results load, in the AOR tab, select the checkboxes next to the Column header AOR ID to select all data files from all selected AORs. All files should now have a blue check indicating selection. \n",
    "- Click `Prepare Download`\n",
    "- Fill in Title as `HAWC+_example_data`\n",
    "- Click `Prepare Download`\n",
    "- After a few minutes, the corresponding data will be downloaded locally.\n",

The AOR tab shows the list of quieried AORs, and the HAWC+ tab shows the list of queried files (Level 4 fits files), including descriptions of each file metadata (details file) and data viewing features.  \"Quality Assurance\" comments associated to each AOR can be found in the AOR tab (shown with the red ellipse). \"Quality Assurance\" comments associated to each file can be found in the HAWC+ tab - in the HISTORY key of each file's header (accessible from the Data tab). Those comments include specific notes from the instrument scientists about data quality, observing complications, and if the observation was an aquisition/calibration observations. "

    "Data levels\n",
    "------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, there are five levels of SOFIA data products:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Level 0: raw SI data in standardized format (HAWC+ only)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Level 1: raw SI data in standardized format (FITS);  for HAWC+, the demodulated (chop and nod subtracted) data comprise Level 1\n",
    "\n",
    "- Level 2: data corrected for instrument artifacts (e.g. flat-fielded, dark-subtracted, bad pixels removed)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Level 3: flux calibrated and telluric corrected data (using FITS keywords; Jy/pix)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Level 4: Level 4 data products comprise everything beyond flux calibrated (Level 3) products. Any data product generated from the combination of Level 3 files (e.g., a map or a mosaic) is considered a Level 4 product. For most instruments, Level 4 data products are usually generated from observations obtained across multiple flights or even multiple flight series and observing cycles. For HAWC+ nod-pol observations, the data product that includes the polarization vectors is Level 4."
