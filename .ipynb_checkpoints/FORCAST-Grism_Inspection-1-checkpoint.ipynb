    "# FORCAST Grism Spectra: Basic Inspection and Assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This recipe provides an overview and sample python code for plotting and assessing FORCAST grism data.  The FORCAST observing modes are described in the SOFIA Observer’s Handbooks, available from the [Proposing and Observing  page on the SOFIA website](https://www.sofia.usra.edu/researchers/proposing-and-observing); and the FORCAST data products are described in the [FORCAST GO Data Handbook](https://www.sofia.usra.edu/sites/default/files/USpot_DCS_DPS/Documents/FORCAST_data_handbook.pdf).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Raw FORCAST data suffers from several instrumental artifacts.  Nearly all of the artifacts are removed or corrected by the  FORCAST pipeline, including: bad pixels; the Droop effect; non-linear pixel response; and the “jailbar” effect.  In addition, the grism pipeline extracts the one-dimensional spectra, applies both wavelength and flux calibration, and corrects for telluric absorption.   For point sources, an \"optimal extraction\" algorithm is used, while for extended (non-point-like) sources, a standard summation over a fixed aperture is used (see recipe on custom extractions for additional information).  See the [FORCAST GO Data Handbook](https://www.sofia.usra.edu/sites/default/files/USpot_DCS_DPS/Documents/FORCAST_GO_HAndbook_RevC.pdf) for details regarding the artifacts, pipeline algorithms, and the flux-calibration process.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Level 3 FORCAST grism data is written in FITS format as a 2-dimensional data array with a single header (for detailed description, see FORCAST GO Data Handbook).  The data is in a 5 x N array, where N is the number of wavelength bins/samples, with the following convention:\n",
    "-  The first line  of the data array contains the wavelength ($\\mu$m);\n",
    "- the second line  contains the pipeline-reduced and flux calibrated spectrum (Jy); \n",
    "- the third line contains the uncertainty (Jy); \n",
    "- the fourth  contains the adopted atmospheric transmission spectrum; \n",
    "- and the fifth contains the instrumental response used in the flux calibration process (Me-/s/Jy, where \"Me-\" is 10^6 electrons).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each FORCAST grism file contains the spectrum for a specific grism, which is indicated in the name of the file, e.g. \"FORG111\" would be a file containing data for the 11.1 $\\mu$m grism.  The pipeline does *not* combine specta from different grisms,  this is left to the user.  \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two data types for  LEVEL 3 FORCAST grism data:\n",
    "1.  CAL files:  flux calibrated results for each raw (LEVEL_1) data file. There can be multiple CAL files for a single AOR.\n",
    "2.  CMB files:  if possible, multiple CAL files for a single AOR are coadded into a \"combined\" data file.  Usually there is only one CMB file per AOR.\n",
    "\n",
    "Except for the provenance, the two datatypes are identical and hence the procedures below are equally valid for both.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"error\" spectrum is for the statistical uncertainty *only* and does not reflect systematic uncertainties in the absolute flux, for example losses due to slit misalignment or poor image quality (see below).   If absolute fluxes are required, it is highly recommended that additional imaging data are obtained at the same time in order to calibrate the grism spectra accurately.  "

    "The most common reason for systematic error in the grism flux data is mis-alignment of the slit during the observation.  Since the width of the FORCAST slits are smaller than the SOFIA PSF in general, the slit only \"samples\" a fraction of the flux from the source.  The FORCAST pipeline accounts for this \"loss\" automatically for each grism using a default PSF model.  However, if the target is not centered on the slit during the observation, or if the image quality is poor, there can be an additional loss that is *not* accounted for in the pipeline processing.  These additional \"slit losses\" can be assessed and \"fixed\" using trusted absolute photometry from the same spectral region.  For the sample data, we also have photometric fluxes for each grism band pass which we use to compare to the grism spectra below."
