Overview
=============================

|Python package|

**Aim**: These documents provide simple “recipes” (i.e., descriptions
and guided examples) for common data analysis objectives using SOFIA
processed data.

**Skill level**: These are generally written for a graduate student
audience. Some of the recipes are ``jupyter`` notebooks designed for a
researcher with a working knowledge of the `numpy/scipy/matplotlib
stack <https://scipy.org/install.html>`__ as well the
`astropy <http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/>`__ modules.

**Contact us**: For questions not addressed in these notebooks or the
SOFIA handbooks, please contact us at the sofia_help@sofia.usra.edu.

**Feedback**: We also encourage you to submit any comments or
suggestions on these notebooks through a new Github
“`Issue <https://github.com/SOFIAObservatory/Recipes/issues/new/choose>`__”.

**Resources**: `SOFIA Data
Handbooks <https://www.sofia.usra.edu/science/proposing-and-observing/data-products/data-resources>`__
